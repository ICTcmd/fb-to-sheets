## Quick Alternative: Create Minimal Business Account

If you don't have a business:

   - Business Name: Your name or "FB Messages Automation" (can be personal)
   - Your Name
   - Your Email

## Important Notes:

- **You can use a personal name** - Facebook allows personal use of Business Manager
