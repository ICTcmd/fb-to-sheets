1. **Copy this URL and replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your App ID:**
   ```
   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/dashboard/
   ```

2. **To find your App ID:**
   - Look at the current page URL in your browser
   - It should look like: `https://developers.facebook.com/apps/123456789/dashboard/`
   - The number `123456789` is your App ID

3. **Then try this direct Messenger setup URL:**
   ```
   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/messenger/settings/
   ```
   
   Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual App ID number!
