# ✅ Messenger Found! Next Steps

## Great News: Messenger is Already Added!

I can see in your dashboard:
- **"Engage with customers on Messenger from Meta use case"**
- It's in the "App customization and requirements" section

---

## What to Do Next:

### Step 1: Click on "Engage with customers on Messenger from Meta"

1. **In the main dashboard area (center)**, find:
   - "App customization and requirements" section
   - Look for: **"Customize the Engage with customers on Messenger from Meta use case"**
   - It has a gray outlined checkmark on the left
   - It has a right-pointing arrow (→) on the right

2. **Click on that entire row/item**

3. **This should take you to Messenger configuration page**

---

## Alternative: Click from Sidebar

I also see in your left sidebar:
- **"Facebook Login for Busi..."** (with briefcase icon)

This suggests you have use cases added. 

**Try clicking on "Use cases"** in the left sidebar, then look for Messenger-related items there.

## What You'll See After Clicking:

Once you click on the Messenger use case, you should see:
- **Access Tokens** section (to get your Page Access Token)
- **Webhooks** section (to configure your webhook URL)
- **Messenger settings**

---

## If Clicking Doesn't Work:

1. **Try clicking "Use cases"** in the left sidebar
2. **Look for Messenger/Business messaging** options
3. **Click on them to configure**

---

## Quick Action:

**Click on:** 
"Customize the Engage with customers on Messenger from Meta use case"

**(In the "App customization and requirements" section, center of your dashboard)**

Let me know what you see after clicking! 🚀
