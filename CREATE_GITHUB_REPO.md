# Create GitHub Repository - Final Steps! ✅

## ✅ Perfect! You're on GitHub Create Repository Page!

**I can see:**
- ✅ Repository name: "fb-to-sheets" (available!) ✅
- ✅ Owner: ICTcmd ✅
- ✅ Visibility: Public ✅
- ✅ Add README: Off (good - we already have one!) ✅
- ✅ Add .gitignore: No .gitignore (good - we already have one!) ✅

---

## Step 1: Add Description (Optional but Recommended)

**In the "Description" field, you can add:**
```
Facebook Page Messages to Google Sheets Automation
```

**Or leave it empty - that's fine too!**

---

## Step 2: Keep Settings As-Is ✅

**Keep these settings:**
- ✅ **Visibility: Public** (or Private if you prefer)
  - Public = Anyone can see code
  - Private = Only you can see code
  - Your choice!

- ✅ **Add README: Off** ✅
  - We already have README.md in your project!
  - Don't add a new one

- ✅ **Add .gitignore: No .gitignore** ✅
  - We already have `.gitignore` in your project!
  - It excludes `credentials.json` and `.env`
  - Don't add a new one

- ✅ **Add license: No license** ✅
  - Fine to leave as is
  - You can add one later if needed

## Step 3: Click "Create repository" Button! 🚀

**The green button at the bottom right:**

## Step 4: Upload Your Code (After Creating Repository)

```
…or push an existing repository from the command line

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**We'll help you upload your code!**
