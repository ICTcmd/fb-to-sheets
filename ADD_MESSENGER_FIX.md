# Adding Messenger - Redirecting Back Means It's Not Added Yet

## Problem: URL redirects back to dashboard

This means Messenger **hasn't been added as a product yet**. You need to add it first!

---

## Method 1: Try Products Page with Setup

Try this URL (replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your App ID):

```
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/products/add/
```

This should show you available products to add, including Messenger.

---

## Method 2: Via "Use Cases" Section

Since you added "Facebook Login" as a use case earlier:

1. **In the left sidebar**, click on **"Use cases"**
2. **Look for:**
   - "Add use case" button
   - "Business messaging" or "Messenger" option
   - Any option related to messaging/chat

3. **Try to add "Business messaging" use case** - this might add Messenger automatically

---

## Method 3: Check Dashboard Content Carefully

1. **In the main dashboard area (center)**, look for:
   - Scroll ALL THE WAY UP to the top
   - Scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN to the bottom
   - Look for ANY blue or green buttons
   - Look for text like:
     - "Get started"
     - "Add integration"
     - "Set up"
     - "Connect"

2. **Try clicking** on any button that looks relevant

---

## Method 4: Try Settings → Basic

1. **In left sidebar**, click on **"Basic"** (under App settings)
2. **Look for tabs** at the top:
   - "Basic" tab
   - "Products" tab ← Click this if you see it!
   - "Advanced" tab

3. **If you see "Products" tab**, click it and look for Messenger

---

## Method 5: Use Search Function

1. **Click the search bar** at top right
2. **Type:** `messenger`
3. **Look for results** and try clicking on them

---

## Method 6: Check Required Actions

1. **In left sidebar**, click on **"Required actions"**
2. **Look for** any mention of products or Messenger
3. There might be a link to add products

---

## Method 7: Try Different URL Patterns

Try these URLs (replace `YOUR_APP_ID`):

1. **Products list:**
   ```
   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/products/
   ```

2. **Add product page:**
   ```
   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/products/add/
   ```

3. **Or try:**
   ```
   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/YOUR_APP_ID/products/add/messenger/
   ```

## What to Look For:

**In the main dashboard content area, do you see:**

- Any buttons at all? (blue, green, gray)
- Any sections that mention "products"?
- Any "Get started" or "Set up" buttons?
- Any empty sections or "Add something" prompts?

**OR**

**When you click "Use cases" in the sidebar:**
- Do you see "Add use case"?
- Do you see "Business messaging"?
- Do you see any messaging-related options?

---

## Quick Questions:

1. **What do you see when you click "Use cases"** in the left sidebar?
2. **What do you see at the TOP of the main dashboard** (center area)?
3. **What do you see at the BOTTOM** of the main dashboard?
4. **Any buttons visible at all** in the center area?
