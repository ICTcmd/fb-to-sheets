# Facebook App Setup - Quick Tips

## Dialog: "Which business portfolio do you want to connect to this app?"

### ✅ What to Do:
1. **Select:** "I don't want to connect a business portfolio yet" (radio button)
2. **Click:** "Next" button

### Why Skip This:
- You don't need a business portfolio for basic Messenger functionality
- You can always add it later if needed
- For receiving Page messages, you only need:
  - Messenger product
  - Page Access Token
  - Webhook setup

---

## Dialog: "Add use cases"

### ✅ What to Do:
- **Option 1:** Click "Cancel" or close the dialog
- **Option 2:** Click "Next" without selecting anything
- **Option 3:** If required, select "Facebook Login" just to proceed

### Why:
- These are optional use cases
- Messenger is added separately as a product (not a use case)
- You don't need any of these for your automation

---

## Page: "Publishing requirements"

### ✅ What to Do:
**Just click "Next"** - You can skip these for now!

### Why Skip:
- **Business Verification** and **App Review** are needed later when you publish your app
- For basic Messenger/webhook functionality (receiving messages), you don't need them yet
- You can complete verification later when you're ready to go live
- For local testing and development, you can proceed without them

### When You'll Need Them:
- Only when you want to publish your app publicly
- Or when you need certain advanced permissions
- For your automation (receiving messages to Google Sheets), they're not required initially

---

## Your Goal:
Get to the **App Dashboard** where you can:
1. Add the **Messenger** product
2. Get your **Page Access Token**
3. Set up **Webhooks**

---

## After These Dialogs/Pages:
Once you're in your app dashboard, look for:
- Left sidebar: Find "Messenger" or "Add Product"
- Click on "Messenger" → "Set Up"
- That's where the real configuration happens!

---

## Quick Rule:
**If a step seems optional or for "later/publishing", click "Next" to proceed!** 

You need to get to the App Dashboard first, then configure Messenger. All the publishing/verification steps can be done later! 🚀
